## Installation
The software can be installed as a python package locally or using Pypi
### Locally
`pip install -e .`
### From Pypi
`pip install csromer`
## Simulate Faraday sources directly in frequency space
CS-ROMER is able to simulate Faraday depth spectra directly in wavelength-squared space. The classes FaradayThinSource and FaradayThickSource inherit directly from dataset, and therefore you can directly use them as an input to your reconstruction.
### Thin sources
```python
import numpy
from csromer.simulation import FaradayThinSource
# Let's create an evenly spaced frequency vector from 1.008 to 2.031 GHz (JVLA setup) 
nu = np.linspace(start=1.008e9, stop=2.031e9, num=1000)
# Let's say that the peak polarized intensity will be 0.0035 mJy/beam with a spectral index = 1.0
peak_thinsource = 0.0035
# The Faraday source will be positioned at phi_0 = -200 rad/m^2
thinsource = FaradayThinSource(nu=nu, s_nu=peak_thinsource, phi_gal=-200, spectral_idx=1.0)
```
### Thick sources
```python
import numpy
from csromer.simulation import FaradayThickSource
# Let's create an evenly spaced frequency vector from 1.008 to 2.031 GHz (JVLA setup) 
nu = np.linspace(start=1.008e9, stop=2.031e9, num=1000)
# Let's say that the peak polarized intensity will be 0.0035 mJy/beam with a spectral index = 1.0
peak_thicksource = 0.0035
# The Faraday source will be positioned at phi_0 = 200 rad/m^2 and with have a width of 140 rad/m^2
thicksource = FaradayThickSource(nu=nu, s_nu=peak_thicksource, phi_fg=140, phi_center=200, spectral_idx=1.0)
```
### Mixed sources
A thin+thick or mixed source is simply a superposition/sum of a thin source and thick source. Therefore we have overriden the `+` operator in order to sum these two objects.
```python
thicksource = thinsource + thicksource
```

### Adding noise to your simulations
### Remove frequency channels randomly as you were doing RFI flagging
