## Installation
The software can be installed as a python package locally or using Pypi
### Locally
`pip install -e .`
### From Pypi
`pip install csromer`
## Simulate Faraday sources directly in frequency space

### Thin sources
### Thick sources
### Mixed sources

### Adding noise to your simulation
### Remove frequency channels randomly as you were doing RFI flagging


## Reconstruct 1D Faraday sources

## Reconstruct a cube
